# Face-recogniton

This project demonstrates a face recognition system using **transfer learning** with the **VGG16** convolutional neural network model. The model has been fine-tuned on a **custom dataset** containing images of **three individuals**, allowing it to classify input face images and recognize which person is in the image.
